# front-end testing kata (Angular edition)

## 🥋 Kata (1/3)

In the source code you will find a very basic TODO application which was built by following these requirements:

- a user can add a non empty task:
  - Enter key submits the form inside input field;
  - input field is cleared and remains in focus upon adding a task;
- a user can mark a task as completed or uncompleted;
- a user can delete any existing task;
- all tasks are stored and retrieved from the user's local storage.

You can inspect the app by running `npm start`. Don't forget to install dependencies (`npm i`) before that!

### 📎 Task

Your task is to write tests for this application as you would normally write them.  
There is only one rule - you **cannot** change any bit of the implementation but you can add as many test related changes (`spec.ts` files, mocking libraries, etc.) as you would like.

Jest is ready to serve your tests with `npm test` command.

When you feel confident about your tests enough - come back here.

### 🏁 Finish

Finished writing your tests? Good, let's jump to another git branch!  
Keep your changes in the working directory (do not stash, commit or discard).  
Don't worry - you won't loose any changes by running the following command.

```sh
git checkout origin/2-kata
```
