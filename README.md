# front-end testing kata (Angular edition)

A very short testing kata[^1] to check yourself how good you are at writing tests in the [Angular](https://angular.io) environment.  
While doing this exercise for the first time - be honest with yourself:

- don't skip instructions and tasks;
- don't peek at other branches in advance;
- write the tests as you would normally write them.

[^1]: A system of individual training exercises in karate and other martial arts.
